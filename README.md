5. Future enhancements: 

- customizable color themes and better accessibility measures (alt text, label names, etc)
-Add 'contact list' to user schema, that (optionally) saves added attendees
-Rather than deleting action items from the list, allow users to mark an item 'complete' and move it to a hidden 'complete' list
-Manipulation of the Date object rather than using strings
